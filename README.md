# CONTACT LIST API

This is an API I built as a challenge for RD Station. It is a shopping cart management system.

## Models

This API works with three models: ```Cart```, ```Product```, and ```CartItem```.  
```CartItem``` acts as an **association model** between ```Cart``` and ```Product```.  
Users can add products to the cart, creating a cart item. However, **products are not directly associated with a cart**â€”they are seeded into the database independently.

### Cart

- ```Cart``` has an ```id```, a ```total_price```, an ```abandoned_at``` timestamp, and a ```last_interaction_at``` timestamp.
- ```Cart``` is associated with ```CartItem```, which links it to multiple ```Product``` records.
- ```total_price``` must be a number equal to or greater than ```0```.
- ```Cart``` is considered **abandoned** if ```abandoned_at``` is not ```nil```.
- ```Cart``` is considered **not abandoned** if ```abandoned_at``` is ```nil```.
- ```Cart``` is **ready for abandonment** if it has not been abandoned and ```last_interaction_at``` was more than ```3 hours ago```.
- ```Cart``` is **ready for deletion** if it has been abandoned for more than ```7 days```.
- ```total_price``` is updated by summing the ```total_price``` of all its ```cart_items```.
- Before saving, ```last_interaction_at``` is set to the current timestamp if it is ```nil```.
- If a ```Cart``` has been abandoned for more than ```7 days```, it will be automatically removed.

### Product

- ```Product``` has an ```id```, a ```name```, and a ```price```.
- ```name``` must be present.
- ```price``` must be a number equal to or greater than ```0```.

### CartItem

- ```CartItem``` has an ```id```, a ```cart_id```, a ```product_id```, a ```quantity```, and a ```total_price```.
- ```CartItem``` belongs to a ```Cart``` and a ```Product```.
- ```quantity``` must be a number greater than ```0```.
- ```total_price``` must be a number equal to or greater than ```0```.
- ```total_price``` is automatically calculated as ```product.price * quantity``` before saving.

## Abandonment System

- This API includes an **abandoned cart system** that automatically processes inactive carts.
- If a ```Cart``` has **no interactions for 3 hours**, it is labeled as **abandoned**.
- If a ```Cart``` remains **abandoned for 7 days**, it is permanently **deleted** from the database.

### **Background Job: `MarkCartAsAbandonedJob`**
- This API uses ```Sidekiq``` to schedule the ```MarkCartAsAbandonedJob```.
- ```MarkCartAsAbandonedJob``` finds all ```Cart``` records **ready for abandonment** and updates their ```abandoned_at``` timestamp.
- It finds all ```Cart``` records **ready for deletion** and permanently removes them.
- Ensures carts inactive for more than ```3 hours``` are marked as abandoned.
- Ensures carts abandoned for more than ```7 days``` are deleted.

## Versions :gem:

#### Docker steps reminders

- Start terminal
- Make sure of permissions of your OS and terminal system are on point. (Don't be afraid to change the shebang in case you need)
- If you're not installing for the first time, don't overwrite archives
- If you're installing a new gem, be always sure to rebuild.
- This application use a series of shell scripts in order to simplify docker and rails commands, they're all written inside the devops folder.


### Build the container and start the DB


```bash
  sh devops/chmod.sh
  ./devops/compose/build.sh --no-cache
  ./devops/compose/up.sh
  ./devops/rails/restart.sh
  ./devops/rails/spec.sh
  ./devops/compose/down.sh
```

### Run Rails server

```bash
    ./devops/compose/up.sh
    ./devops/rails/server.sh
    # CTRL + C
    ./devops/compose/down.sh
```

### Run Rails console

```bash
    ./devops/compose/up.sh
    ./devops/rails/console.sh
    # CTRL + C
    ./devops/compose/down.sh
```

### Update DB and Rails

```bash
    ./devops/compose/up.sh
    ./devops/rails/update.sh
    # CTRL + C
    ./devops/compose/down.sh
```

### Uninstall

```bash
  ./devops/compose/down.sh
  ./devops/compose/delete.sh
```

## DB reminders

- If you're having trouble when opening on a DB management system (like Beekeeper, DBeaver, PG Admin, etc.), don't forget that you need to run the container and use localhost as your host. 
- If any role issues appear Don't be afraid to pkill postgres and brew services stop postgresql (If you're running in homebrew).
- If you are having trouble with users accessing the DB, rebuild the container.
